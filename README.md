# 🛠️ Homelab DevOps Progress Tracker

This repository tracks my journey in learning and applying **DevOps engineering** practices through hands-on homelab projects.

## 🧠 Background

I started with **Docker Swarm**, but after running into its limitations, I transitioned to using **Kubernetes** — specifically a **3-node K3s cluster** with one manager node. This move helped me understand container orchestration at a deeper level.

## 🚀 Current Goals

- Deploy and manage my own containers and pods using **official documentation** only
- Avoid using tutorials to build self-reliance and deepen understanding
- Ask ChatGPT **only when completely stuck**, and always **fact-check AI suggestions** before applying them
- Maintain all stack configurations, manifests, and infra as code in this repository

## 📦 Current Setup

- **Docker**: For containerizing all services
- **K3s**: Lightweight Kubernetes for managing multi-node infrastructure
- **Thinkpad E14**: My mobile workstation for testing, live debugging, and on-the-go infrastructure adjustments.
- **Vaultwarden, Plex, Adminer, and more**: Deployed as part of my stacks
- **Tailscale + Cloudflare Tunnel**: For secure remote access

## 🧾 Notes

Everything here reflects real mistakes, learning, and iteration — this repo isn't polished for show, it's built for growth. 💪
